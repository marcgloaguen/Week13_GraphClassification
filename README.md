# Week13_GraphClassification

## Description
The PROTEINS dataset is a collection of protein sequences used in bioinformatics and machine learning research. It consists of amino acid sequences with associated labels indicating the functional class of each protein. This dataset is commonly employed to develop and evaluate algorithms for protein classification and bioinformatics tasks. Researchers use PROTEINS to train machine learning models that can predict the functional properties of proteins based on their amino acid sequences.


You can find the dataset by using this line of code with deep graph library :
dataset = dgl.data.GINDataset("PROTEINS", self_loop=True)
## Mission
Your mission this week is to address the following tasks and questions:
Training a model for Graph Classification
1. Load the dataset
2. Train a graph classification model using deep graph library and the pytorch syntax
3. Evaluate the performance of your model
## Presentation
Share the building process of your models and present the PROTEINS dataset in a 5/10-minute presentation.
